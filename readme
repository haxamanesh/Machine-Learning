# Customer Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior data to identify patterns and insights. It uses various techniques including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and clustering.

## Steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads customer behavior data from a CSV file.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, removes duplicates, and encodes categorical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Performs descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualizations to understand the data.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Drops irrelevant or redundant features like 'BounceRates', 'ProductRelated', and 'Informational'.
5. **Clustering:** Applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their behavior.
6. **Visualization:** Visualizes the clusters using scatter plots and other techniques.

## Requirements:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `yellowbrick`

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib yellowbrick
```

## Usage:

1. Upload your customer behavior data as a CSV file.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook code.
3. Analyze the results and visualizations to gain insights into customer behavior.
